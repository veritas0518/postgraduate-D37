This morning, I went to sleep for a while. I wanted to put my computer in my computer bag. When I went to the library, I found that my computer bag was left in other people's dormitory. When I came back from the library yesterday, I found that I had forgotten my key, but one of my roommates went out for dinner, one went home, and the other didn't come back until around 10 o'clock. I had to stay in other people's dormitories for a while, and I didn't open the door until about 10:15. But I forgot to take back my computer bag. This morning, I wanted to get back my computer bag and found that the door was locked, This bedroom is usually unlocked. I forgot to take my computer bag and locked the door. It may be aimed at me. I feel very sick. The problem of course selection has not been solved, but Monday is a holiday, and the final exam is coming soon. I'm very anxious, and I can't go to the library today.
